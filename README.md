## ðŸ“¦ Features

- ðŸ§² **Trace Collection** â€“ Capture power traces, plaintexts, and ciphertexts from target devices.
- ðŸ“ˆ **CPA Attack** â€“ Perform correlation-based key recovery from collected traces.
- ðŸ§  **DOM Attack** â€“ Analyze masked cryptographic implementations using DOM attack strategies.
